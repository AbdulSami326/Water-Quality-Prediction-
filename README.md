💧 Water Quality Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict water quality based on various chemical and environmental parameters.

🚀 Project Overview
Water quality assessment is critical for environmental safety and public health. This project processes water quality datasets, trains predictive models, and classifies water quality into categories.

🛠️ Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Prediction of water quality class based on input parameters

🧩 Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- NumPy

 📂 Repository Contents
- `data/`: Dataset files (if applicable)
- `model.pkl`: Trained machine learning model
